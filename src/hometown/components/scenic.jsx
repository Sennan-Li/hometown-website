            <h1>Shenzhen Bay Park</h1>
            <p>It's hard to imagine many other cities having the gumption to construct a gorgeous, 13-kilometre-long coastal park that knits together two city districts and provides recreation space for thousands of residents. Shenzhen Bay park has palm-shaded bike lanes, jogging and walking paths and inspiring sea views along its length. Best of all, it's a viable way to get from one side of the city to the other. </p>

If you're blessed with crystal clear skies, scurry for the superfast elevators and drink in vistas, from the emerald wilds of Wutongshan to shimmering Hong Kong Island.</p>

It takes about 30 minutes to reach the top, where you can rub shoulders with Deng Xiaoping in statue form, the politician who sowed the seeds for Shenzhen's rise.</p>

            <h1>Window of the World</h1>
            <p>In Shenzhen's early days, what every up-and-coming city needed was theme parks. Welcome Window of the World, a way to travel the globe without really travelling. The mini monuments, from Stonehenge to the Taj Mahal, are endearing and endlessly photogenic. In a city perpetually enthralled with the new, Window of the World is a soothing return to a more innocent age, when the world beyond China's borders seemed far away.</p>
